NOTE: If you're running VMWare and need to attach a YubiKey in composite mode,
you will need to make changes to the .vmx file to allow you to attach HID
devices:
  usb.generic.allowHID = "TRUE"
  usb.generic.allowLastHID = "TRUE"
You may also want to disable "Smart Card Sharing" since it doesn't seem to work.
  usb.ccid.useSharedMode = "FALSE"
